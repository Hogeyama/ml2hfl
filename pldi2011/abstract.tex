Higher-order model checking (more precisely, the model checking of 
higher-order recursion schemes) has been extensively studied recently, 
which can automatically decide properties of programs written in the 
simply-typed \(\lambda\)-calculus with recursion and \emph{finite} data 
domains. This paper formalizes predicate abstraction and 
counterexample-guided abstraction refinement (CEGAR) for higher-order 
model checking, enabling automatic verification of programs that use 
\emph{infinite} data domains such as integers. A prototype verifier for 
higher-order functional programs based on the formalization has been 
implemented and tested for several programs.
