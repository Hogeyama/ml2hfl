The regular Sudoku rules

  Only two positive rules:
   (0) Each line and each column should be a complete set of digits.
   (1) Each 3x3 square should be a complete set of digits.

The derived Sudoku rules

  From the Sudoku rules, we can derive the two following (negative) rules:
   (2) No two identical digits can be in any line or column.
   (3) No two identical digits can be in any 3x3 square.

The extended Sudoku rules

  Same positive rules, except that squares are replaced with rectangles.

Examples of extended Sudoku

  A simple generalization of the regular Sudoku would be to take 4x4
  squares. This leads to 16 digits instead of 9; we could choose the
  usual hexadecimal notation for those digits, i.e.
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.

  The board can be made of rectangles 2 places in height and 5 places
  in width; then, the board will get 2 columns and 5 rows of those
  rectangles; there will be 10 digits in the set digits, for instance
  0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 
  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, if you prefer the hexadecimal notation
  and/or do not like 0.
