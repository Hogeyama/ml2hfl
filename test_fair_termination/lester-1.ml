(* The property checked in the original example is "AG (Close1 -> AF Close2)"
   In the program above, we have added a flag that expresses whether
   Close1 happened, so that 
   once Close1 occurs, it occurs infinitely often

(*{SPEC}
   fairness: (Call, Close1)  (* either Close1 happens only finitely often, or *)
   fairness: (Close2, Never) (* Close2 happens infinitely often *)
{SPEC}*)
