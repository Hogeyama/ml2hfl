\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed extensions and refinements to realize a scalable
software model checker for higher-order programs.  The proposed method
is simple and general for verifications of higher-order programs.  We
have identified the problems of the previous verification method, and proposed
the optimization techniques to overcome the problems.  We have
implemented a prototype verifier for higher-order programs with lists,
which works well for several programs.  An implementation for general
recursive data structures and experiments are left for future work.
