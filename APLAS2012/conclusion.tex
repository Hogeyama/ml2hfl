\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed a fully automated verification framework for
higher-order programs with recursive data structures and control
operations.  The proposed encoding is simple and general for
verifications of higher-order programs.  We identify the problems of the
previous verification method, and propose the optimization techniques to
overcome the problems.  We have implemented a prototype verifier for
higher-order programs with lists, which works well for several programs.
An implementation for general recursive data structures and experiments
are left for future work.
