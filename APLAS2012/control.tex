\subsection{Extension for Control Operations}
\label{sec:control} We can extend the framework to deal with control
operations (e.g., exceptions and \texttt{call/cc}) by removing these
from a program by CPS transformation~\cite{Nielsen2001}.

%Consider the following program (written in OCaml style).
The following program calculates factorial and raise an exception if
a negative number or zero is given.
\begin{alltt}
exception NotPositive
let rec fact n =
  if n <= 0 then raise NotPositive
  else try n * fact (n - 1) exn with NotPositive -> 1
let main n = try fact n with NotPositive -> assert (n <= 0); 0
\end{alltt}
We can translate this program to an exception-free program by CPS transformation.
The following is the result of CPS transformation.
\begin{alltt}
type exc = NotPositive
let rec fact n k exn =
  if n <= 0 then exn NotPositive
  else let exn' e = match e with NotPositive -> k 1 in
         fact (n - 1) (fun r -> k (n * r))) exn'
let main n k =
  fact n k (fun e -> match e with NotPositive -> assert (n <= 0); k 0
                                | _ -> assert false)
\end{alltt}
Once the exception is removed, we can apply our verification method to the
program.
